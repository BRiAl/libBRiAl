This repo was an experiment in splitting parts of the BRiAl package.
It is fully discontinued in favor of the main BRiAl repository.
It is obsolete and shouldn't be used.

BRiAl is the legacy version of PolyBoRi maintained by sagemath developers.

libBRiAl is the C/C++ library part of BRiAl.

The building requisite for libBRiAl are
* A modern C compiler supporting the C99 standard
* A modern C++ compiler supporting at least the C++98 standard and preferably the C++11
* A recent Boost release
* Optionally (but highly recommended) the m4ri library
